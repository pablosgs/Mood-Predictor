# Mood-Predictor

In this project, the mood of a person is predicted based on its activity on the smartphone.

The data set for this research originates from sensory data collected by support applications for depressed individuals. The data set summarizes daily usage data from around the start of February until the end of April. Possible predictor variables are the time spent on certain types of applications in seconds (e.g. weather apps, games, office apps, etc ...), the overall screen time in seconds, the user activity reported in a range from 1 to 0 and the sms and call per day as either 0 or 1. Apart from the user’s mood, the level of emotional valence and arousal are recorded as well as values between -2 and 2. Problem Statement The aim of this research is to explore which and how smartphone usage patterns influence a person’s mood. Furthermore, we will apply different machine learning approaches to predict a smartphone user’s mood and compare different the methods and models.

To do so, three models are developed, a Linear Regression, a Random Forest and ARIMA. Due to the temporal nature of the data, for Linear Regression and Random Forest data had to be properly prepared.
